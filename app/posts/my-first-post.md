description: A brief explainer about what I intend for this website to be.
---

As I’ve already said on the home page (unless I’ve changed things — damn you,
future me!), welcome to my website! I intend for this site to be a place for my
thoughts and work in software development.

In my career, I’ve worked exclusively in web development, so my posts will
likely lean in that direction; but not entirely. I’m also interested in systems
programming, distributed systems, functional programming, formal methods, and
machine learning. I live and breathe JavaScript, though I’m also into Rust and
Lean. Hopefully that gives you a sense of what you might expect from my site and
maybe something there will even be of interest to you!

Lastly, although I might use an LLM to correct my bad grammar, content on this
site will _always_ be written by yours truly.
