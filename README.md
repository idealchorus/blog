# Blog

This is the repo for [my personal website](idealchorus.com). I've made it public
because I thought it might be a useful tool for those who are working with a
similar stack. It's built on React, React Router, Markdoc, and TailwindCSS. It's
currently being hosted on Vercel's platform.

Also, If I made any typos or errors on the site, feel free to open a PR with a
fix.

## TODO

Here's a list of the things I need to do to the site.

- Render created and edited date as separate entities
- Add styles for all markdown structures (e.g. code snippets, alerts, etc.)
- Searching
- Tag system (e.g. posts have tags that can be filtered on)
- View transitions between pages
