# Blog

This is the repo for [my personal website](idealchorus.com). I've made it public
because I thought it might be a useful tool for those who are working with a
similar stack. It's built on React, React Router, Markdoc, and TailwindCSS. It's
currently being hosted on Vercel's platform.

Also, If I made any typos or errors on the site, feel free to open a PR with a
fix.

## TODO

- Render created and edited date as separate entities
- View transitions
- Tag system
- Add styles for all markdown structures (e.g. code snippets, alerts, etc.)
